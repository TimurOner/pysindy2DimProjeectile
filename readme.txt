
  The project is a Python 3 notebook which was made on Google Colab and is best run on Google Colab. You need to have a 
  Google account to use Google Colab. You can tune the parameters and play with the code after opening it on Google Colab.
  You should start running the cells in the code from top to the bottom. I haven't tried to run this project on any other
  enivornment besides Google Colab yet. Contact me for any suggestions or questions.
